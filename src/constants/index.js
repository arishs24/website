Unfortunately during these types of activities, Tahani experiences a frequent failure of the snap-in coupling of the flange and the pouch.

The bag will then have to be fitted to the flange and twisted down so it locks in place.  2. Further supported by velcro attachments (see Figure 2) 2. **Second Component:** an elastic strap to stabilize the bag. 1. two clips on either side of the elastic band will then allow the user to secure the ends to the waistband of their pants in a desired position.",

The challenges we had faced along the way had given way to several learning opportunities that contributed to the iterative nature of the project, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, through testing, and continuous refinement in the engineering design process. This project helped reinforce the importance of time management and organization, as many milestones and conceptual designs required the team to meet outside of class hours. There was also a significant emphasis on problem-solving throughout the project.
