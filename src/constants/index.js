She has a very physically demanding job that requires frequent twisting and bending of the abdomen. Unfortunately during these types of activities, Tahani experiences a frequent failure of the snap-in coupling of the flange and the pouch. With regular use, including a frequent need to adjust bag positioning, Tahani has found that the coupling loses its secure connection resulting in her ostomy bag falling off on multiple occasions. ",

      "Responsibilities and Contributions": "As a coordinator, I recommended kinetic tape and took notes during team meetings.Our solution consists of two main components: 1. **First Component:** two-part twist-lock system. 1. the flange has a set of tabs that can be fitted into the slots present on the bag. The bag will then have to be fitted to the flange and twisted down so it locks in place.  2. Further supported by velcro attachments (see Figure 2) 2. **Second Component:** an elastic strap to stabilize the bag. 1. two clips on either side of the elastic band will then allow the user to secure the ends to the waistband of their pants in a desired position.",

The challenges we had faced along the way had given way to several learning opportunities that contributed to the iterative nature of the project, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, through testing, and continuous refinement in the engineering design process. This project helped reinforce the importance of time management and organization, as many milestones and conceptual designs required the team to meet outside of class hours.
