    <p>
      <strong>Iteration 1 ‚Äì Conceptual Framework:</strong><br />
      Our earliest design was focused on simply tracking motion without feedback. It involved a basic orientation sensor and servo, but lacked logic for correcting form. We quickly realized this didn‚Äôt provide the personalized rehab support our patient needed.

    <p>
      <strong>Iteration 2 ‚Äì Form Correction Logic:</strong><br />
      After collecting test data, I added a rule-based system to detect incorrect bicep curl angles. This version introduced a buzzer alert but had hardcoded thresholds that didn‚Äôt adjust for different users. Feedback showed it was too rigid for varying patient needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Iteration 3 ‚Äì Calibration Phase + ML Logic:</strong><br />
      We then introduced a calibration phase that captured the user‚Äôs full range of motion and used it to generate personalized thresholds. This allowed us to adjust servo resistance and alert timing dynamically. I led the development of this logic and integrated it with real-time sensor data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Iteration 4 ‚Äì GUI & Patient Feedback:</strong><br />
      I designed and integrated a Tkinter GUI to visualize form tracking and feedback. Patient testers found this version more helpful, and we refined the layout using <code>matplotlib</code> to show motion graphs and resistance trends. Final tweaks were made to optimize for low-lag performance on Raspberry Pi.

  <div className="space-y-6 text-[17px] text-white leading-relaxed">
    <aside>
      üë§ One of the biggest realizations I had during this project was that designing for rehabilitation isn't just about the tech , it's about <strong>timing, comfort, and clarity.</strong> Every time I asked myself, ‚ÄúWould I actually trust this device to guide my recovery?‚Äù, I discovered new gaps in how we presented feedback or structured our data flow. The complexity of integrating real-time servo motion with user-specific sensor data pushed me to rethink how feedback loops should feel , not just how they should function. It wasn‚Äôt enough to get a signal; we had to <strong>translate</strong> it in a way that was actionable and smooth for the user.
    </aside>

    <p>
      <strong>Machine Learning & Personalized Resistance:</strong><br />
      One of the most technically rewarding yet demanding components of this project was implementing a machine learning-inspired logic system that adjusted servo motor resistance based on individual user calibration. Leading this part of the system, I had to translate sensor data into meaningful mechanical response, balancing accuracy, responsiveness, and user safety. Debugging involved extensive iteration as I refined how the servo responded to sensor-detected movement in real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Graphical Interface & Real-Time Feedback:</strong><br />
      Creating the GUI using Tkinter involved integrating real-time orientation sensor data with graphical feedback. I designed a clean layout that could dynamically display form tracking and motion graphs using <code>matplotlib</code>. The challenge lay in building a responsive interface that wouldn‚Äôt lag while rendering live values. This part taught me to optimize data processing and UI responsiveness under Raspberry Pi limitations. I kept asking myself: <strong>Is this readable during a workout? Will the average user know what to do next?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Cross-Subteam Integration:</strong><br />
      Working with teammates from mechanical and electrical subteams exposed the importance of technical translation,converting abstract computing logic into practical control for motors and gears. I learned to align my backend systems with physical limitations, bridging the computing subteam‚Äôs goals with the mechanical constraints of the build.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Coordinator Perspective:</strong><br />
      Managing our team outside of Design Studio while developing a core system made me juggle roles I wasn‚Äôt used to. I had to shift quickly between discussing servo torque limits, debugging Raspberry Pi GPIO logic, and documenting our project updates for the TA. That kind of task-switching taught me a lot about prioritization, empathy, and cross-functional thinking.

        üß† This project wasn‚Äôt just about building a prototype,it was about learning how to bring code, components, and people together toward one goal. And often, that meant unlearning what I thought I knew. There were countless moments I‚Äôd revisit my logic and ask, <strong>Is this really the cleanest way? Is there a better method that makes this more modular, readable, or user-safe?</strong> One of the biggest wins was when we restructured our calibration logic around a flexible threshold range instead of relying on strict positional checks. That change alone simplified our flow and boosted accuracy significantly.

      <p>
        <strong>Initial Hurdles:</strong><br />
        In the early development stages, aligning the orientation sensor values with consistent thresholds was difficult. Noise, drift, and inconsistent arm movement made it hard to establish a baseline. Rather than giving up, I focused on smoothing techniques and logical conditions to eliminate false alerts. Our breakthrough came from redefining the threshold not as a fixed point, but as a window.
      </p>




      <p>
        <strong>Backend Complexity & Physical Constraints:</strong><br />
        Building real-time feedback systems required handling GPIO delays, buffering sensor reads, and syncing them with servo output. The feedback loop needed to be both fast and safe,an ongoing challenge as we balanced performance with control precision. I learned to debug across hardware and software layers simultaneously, building stronger problem-solving habits.

      <p>
        <strong>Team Collaboration & Technical Communication:</strong><br />
        In addition to leading the computing logic, I served as the Project Coordinator, organizing meetings, maintaining logs, and managing communications with the TA. Balancing these organizational duties with a heavy technical workload pushed me to improve both my technical writing and time management.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Growth & Takeaways:</strong><br />
        I walked away from FlexAid with more than just a working prototype, I walked away with a deeper respect for collaborative systems engineering. I‚Äôve learned that iteration is not a sign of failure but a signal that you‚Äôre moving closer to a solution that actually works.
      </p>

      <p className="text-yellow-300">
        <strong>What I Could‚Äôve Done Better:</strong> I could have allocated more time for early-stage testing, particularly for the servo-triggered feedback system.<br />
        <strong>Outcome:</strong> This would‚Äôve exposed integration bugs sooner, allowing for a smoother calibration experience and improved performance leading up to Expo.
