    <p><strong>Iteration 2 ‚Äì Sensor Activation:</strong><br />Implemented FSR input logic to detect heel/toe pressure. While triggering the servo was successful, we ran into latency and delayed motion, especially at higher cadence.</p>
    <p><strong>Iteration 3 ‚Äì Housing & Integration:</strong><br />We redesigned our gear mount and printed a cleaner PLA casing. We also implemented a working GUI to show cadence, alerts, and flexion status in real time, all run through the Raspberry Pi.</p>
    <p>Each iteration brought us closer to a refined, user-focused assistive device. Our final prototype merged functional coding, sensor accuracy, and physical comfort into one cohesive system.</p>

  <div className="space-y-6 text-[17px] text-white leading-relaxed">
    <aside>
      üëü One of the most interesting challenges in this project was learning how *sensitive* movement-based assistive tech is to timing. We weren‚Äôt just building something that worked‚Äîwe were building something that had to move with the user‚Äôs body. Every test left us asking: *Did we lift too soon? Was the motion too jerky? Could someone with MS actually rely on this mid-run?* That question shaped everything we did.
    </aside>

    <img
      src="/dp/i1.png"
      alt="Tkinter UI Screenshot"
      className="rounded-lg shadow-md my-4 w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Servo Sync & FSR Timing:</strong><br />
      The servo wasn‚Äôt the hard part‚Äîthe hard part was knowing *when* to activate it. We started with simple FSR triggers but quickly ran into noise, debounce issues, and calibration drift. I worked closely with the mech subteam to tune our code so the chain-and-gear mechanism would lift at the precise right moment during a gait cycle, avoiding early or late lifts that threw off stride.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Rethinking Gait Detection:</strong><br />
      Initially, we treated the heel and toe sensors as binary triggers. But running isn‚Äôt binary‚Äîit‚Äôs fluid. I learned to implement a small buffer window to ignore micro-fluctuations and stabilize step detection. That made our servo more predictable and drastically reduced false lifts. Each code change made me ask: *Would this adjustment make the device feel smarter, or just more rigid?*
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Mechanical Collaboration:</strong><br />
      One of our biggest bugs wasn‚Äôt in the code‚Äîit was in chain tension. Misalignment led to servo stalls and gear skipping. I helped iterate on the gear housing so that it aligned naturally with the servo shaft. This experience taught me that even perfect logic fails if physical tolerances aren‚Äôt respected.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Human Factors & Comfort:</strong><br />
      A big turning point was testing the device while walking. The servo triggered perfectly‚Äîbut it felt intrusive. I realized then that performance doesn‚Äôt equal comfort. I began approaching each hardware revision with the mindset: *Would Bradley even want to wear this? Could he forget it‚Äôs there?* That question became a filter for every UX decision.

      <aside>
        üß† EZ Step wasn‚Äôt just a device‚Äîit was a challenge in designing trust. If your device lifts a foot a fraction too late, the user loses confidence. And once that trust is gone, it‚Äôs hard to get back. This project made me realize how important it is to prototype *for* the user, not just *around* them. Every design decision needs to answer: *Will the user feel supported? Will this feel natural enough to rely on every day?*
      </aside>

      <p>
        <strong>Initial Calibration Challenges:</strong><br />
        Early testing was plagued by inconsistent readings from our FSR sensors. We struggled to define what a ‚Äústep‚Äù looked like‚Äîheel strike? toe lift? both? Our breakthrough came when we staggered the two sensor readings and treated cadence as a rhythmic pattern, not an isolated event. It made the system smarter, more adaptable, and less prone to false triggers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Building Around Delay:</strong><br />
        One of the hardest parts was accepting that our servo *would* have delay. Rather than fighting it, I worked with the team to predict it‚Äîpreloading signals slightly earlier to make the lift *feel* instantaneous. I learned that engineering isn‚Äôt always about eliminating limitations‚Äîit‚Äôs often about designing *around* them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Team Dynamics & Documentation:</strong><br />
        As Subject Matter Expert, I wasn‚Äôt just responsible for tech. I had to ensure our research was sound, that citations were valid, and that documentation could be handed off to future teams. It pushed me to think beyond this one prototype‚Äîhow could our work set the foundation for something that actually reaches people like Bradley?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Growth & Takeaways:</strong><br />
        This project pushed me to slow down and listen‚Äîto teammates, to the hardware, and to the simulated user feedback. I used to think a successful build was one that *worked.* Now I know it‚Äôs one that works *well enough to forget it‚Äôs even there.* That‚Äôs what we aimed for with EZ Step.
      </p>

      <p className="text-yellow-300">
        <strong>What I Could‚Äôve Done Better:</strong> Started gait testing and servo timing trials much earlier in the design cycle.<br />
        <strong>Outcome:</strong> Would‚Äôve exposed comfort issues sooner and allowed us to optimize real-time responsiveness more gradually.
